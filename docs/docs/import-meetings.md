### Purpose

This functionality allows you to import your Zoom Meetings from your Zoom Account to your WordPress site if that meeting already does not exists on your site.

**If you need to import recurring meetings and webinars, [PRO VERSION](https://www.codemanas.com/downloads/video-conferencing-with-zoom-pro/) plugin is required.**

### How to ?

1. Goto Zoom Meetings > Sync page
2. Choose which user you would like to import from.
3. Select your meetings to be imported.

**`NOTE: You can only import 10 meetings at a time. This is done to reduce API call usage and avoiding API call exhaustion on the server side.`**
